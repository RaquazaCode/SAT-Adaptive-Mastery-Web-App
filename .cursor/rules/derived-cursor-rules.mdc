## PROJECT OVERVIEW

This document outlines the rules and guidelines for the AI coding assistant to ensure consistent, high-quality code and efficient collaboration on this project. It covers code style, folder organization, tech stack, project-specific standards, workflow, and debugging.

## CODE STYLE

*   Follow industry best practices for code readability and maintainability.
*   Use consistent indentation (e.g., 2 spaces for JavaScript/TypeScript).
*   Write clear and concise comments to explain complex logic.
*   Adhere to the principles of DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).

## FOLDER ORGANIZATION

*   Maintain a clear and logical folder structure.
*   Group related files together.
*   Use descriptive names for folders and files.
*   The `src` directory should contain all source code.
*   Component files should be located in `src/components`.
*   Use a `/reference` folder for visual references like screenshots and exported HTML.
*   Use `/prd` for core product specifications.
*   Use `/research` for research documents.
*   Consider a `/docs` folder, potentially with `/docs/prd` for product overviews (see WORKFLOW & RELEASE RULES).

## TECH STACK

*   React
*   TypeScript
*   Tailwind CSS
*   Vite

## PROJECT-SPECIFIC STANDARDS

*   TBD - Will be defined as the project evolves.

## WORKFLOW & RELEASE RULES

*   Use Git for version control.
*   Create branches for new features or bug fixes.
*   Submit pull requests for code review.
*   Follow a defined release process (TBD).
*   The first commit should ideally include:
    *   A running app
    *   A README with setup steps
    *   A basic `/docs/prd/00-overview.md` (or equivalent in `/prd`)
    *   `.cursor/rules.md` (this file)
    *   `ENV.example` (even if empty) plus `.env.local` in `.gitignore`
    *   Prettier + ESLint configured
*   Subsequent commits should be staged properly and step-by-step.

## REFERENCE EXAMPLES

*   TBD - Examples of code patterns, component structures, etc., will be added here as the project progresses.

## PROJECT DOCUMENTATION & CONTEXT SYSTEM

*   Maintain up-to-date documentation for all major components and features.
*   Use a consistent documentation style.
*   Document any project-specific decisions or deviations from standard practices.

## DEBUGGING

*   Utilize browser developer tools for front-end debugging.
*   Employ logging and debugging techniques appropriate for the tech stack.

## FINAL DOs AND DON'Ts

*   **DO** write clean, well-documented code.
*   **DO** follow the established coding style and project standards.
*   **DO** ask questions when unsure.
*   **DON'T** commit code without testing.
*   **DON'T** repeat code unnecessarily.
*   **DO** prefer downloading code templates over screenshotting and saving as HTML.
*   **DO** establish one source of truth for the codebase.
*   **DO** use Git from the start.
*   **DO** keep design references separate from the codebase.
*   **DO** check for `package.json` (or similar) to identify a real project.
*   **DO** consider adding attribution to the README for the original template.
